# hello-world
This is my first repository, made following the **GitHub** *Quickstart Tutorial*.
Prior to this, I've mostly coded in **Wolfram** *Mathematica* and **Microsoft** *Excel*; this is a new language, a new format, and a new system.
I am also currently taking the MOOC *Web Design for Everybody* on Coursera through the **University of Michigan**.<br>
I see that certain HTML tags (like the br I just used) work in .md files, but do they all? It's a wild new world, and there's a lot to learn.
1. Short-term goal: finish WD4E Intros to CSS and JavaScript before leaving for the summer.
2. Medium-term goal: create a good-quality website for a book-lending library I want to start with my friends.
3. Long-term goal: develop skills needed to pursue career in tech, especially at HubSpot. <br>

Ok, this is fun. Now back to the course.
